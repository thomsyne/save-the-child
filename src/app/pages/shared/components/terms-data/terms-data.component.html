      <p>
        1.1.5 A Subscriber may issue a purchase order or any additional
        written documentation or communication for its own administrative
        purposes only. Where such additional documentation or
        communication contains provisions, which are at variance with the
        provisions set out in any part of the Contract, such additional
        documentation and communication shall be null and void, as they
        relate to the subscription and use of the Platform and the

        services thereof posted on the Platform or Accelerex's website

        covenants, and all inducements prior to the acceptance and signing
        of the Contract, relied upon by either Party, whether written or

        Contract, shall vary or modify the written terms of the Contract
        in any way whatsoever. No course of prior dealings between the

        5.2.4 Accelerex is not responsible and accepts no liability for
        Subscriber Content. Accelerex does not actively monitor any
        Subscriber Content, but the Subscriber agrees that at any time
        Accelerex shall be entitled to delete any Subscriber Content that
        Accelerex reasonably believes is in breach of Section 5.2.3 above.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.2.5 In the event of any loss or damage to Subscriber Content,
        the Subscriber’s sole and exclusive remedy shall be for Accelerex
        to use reasonable commercial endeavours to restore the lost or
        damaged Subscriber Content from the latest back up of such
        Subscriber Content maintained by Accelerex. The Subscriber
        acknowledges and agrees that this process will overwrite the
        Subscriber Content stored on the Platform prior to the
        restoration. Accordingly, the Subscriber shall separately maintain
        up-to-date copies of the Subscriber Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.2.6 If Subscriber Content includes Personal Data, the Subscriber
        shall notify us of the subject matter of the Personal Data and the
        categories of data subjects. Accelerex shall process the
        Subscriber Content for the duration of the Subscriber’s Access to
        the Platform and only for the purposes of its Access to the
        Platform. The Subscriber warrants that in providing Personal Data
        to Accelerex:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) it has complied with the Data Protection Legislation in
        processing such Personal Data;
      </p>
      <p>
        b) it shall only provide such Personal Data as is necessary for
        its normal business purposes; and
      </p>
      <p>
        c) by providing the Platform to the Subscriber, Accelerex may
        lawfully process such Personal Data in accordance with the
        requirements of the Data Protection Legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.2.7 If and to the extent Accelerex is deemed to be a processor
        of the Personal Data as defined in the Data Protection
        Legislation, it shall:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) not transfer the Personal Data to any third party without the
        Subscriber’s prior specific or general written authorization;
      </p>
      <p>
        b) ensure that its Personnel authorized to process the Personal
        Data have agreed to keep the Personal Data confidential;
      </p>
      <p>
        c) taking into account the state of the art, the costs of
        implementation and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of
        processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity
        for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, implement
        appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a
        level of security appropriate to the risk;
      </p>
      <p>
        d) taking into account the nature of the processing, assist the
        Subscriber by appropriate technical and organizational measures,
        insofar as this is possible, for the fulfillment of the
        Subscriber’s obligation to respond to requests for exercising the
        data subject’s rights under the Data Protection Legislation;
      </p>
      <p>
        e) at the Subscriber’s choice, delete or return all Personal Data
        to the Subscriber on termination of the subscription to the
        Platform and delete all copies subject to any other legal
        requirements;
      </p>
      <p>
        f) make available to the Subscriber all information necessary to
        demonstrate compliance and assist the Subscriber in meeting its
        legal obligations in relation to the security of processing, the
        notification of Personal Data breaches and data protection impact
        assessments;
      </p>
      <p>
        g) submit to audits and inspections by the Subscriber or its
        auditor to ensure that Accelerex are complying with our
        obligations under this Section subject to reasonable notice and in
        any event only during our normal working hours; and

        property shall not be used in connection with products or services

        potential clients. Without limiting the foregoing, Accelerex
        grants to the Subscriber together with the Access and at no
        additional cost, a non-exclusive and non-transferable license to
        use Accelerex’s name and logo to inform its Customers of its
        cooperation with Accelerex.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.4.2 The Subscriber shall not, and shall not permit or assist any

        5.4.3 The Subscriber understands and agrees that Accelerex shall
        be entitled to record its Access and use of the Platform to
        diagnose and fix problems, training, and support. Accelerex may
        transfer such records to third parties for analysis and
        processing. No Personal Data shall be included in the records that
        Accelerex transfers to third parties, and Accelerex shall use
        reasonable endeavours to ensure that such third parties keep all
        such records confidential.

      <p>
        5.4.4 The Subscriber shall promptly notify Accelerex of any claim,
        notification or allegation that it receives that its use of the

        d) mitigate its losses in relation to a Claim, including where
        requested to do so by stopping the use of the Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.4.5 On receipt of a notice under Section 5.4.4, Accelerex shall
        at its sole expense either procure for the Subscriber the right to
        continue accessing and using the Platform or modify or replace the
